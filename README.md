# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task:
This week's homework required us to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This application also uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

## Built With:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/)
* [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
